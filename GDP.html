    <h2>Summary Report</h2>
        <h3>Importance</h3>
        <p><ul>
         <li>Generating more GDP in New Brunswick will increase the province's tax base and allow for the provision of a higher standard of public services </li>
         <li>It will also generate more opportunities for employment and raise the incomes of New Brunswickers, allowing for higher levels of consumption</li>  </ul> </p>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p><ul>
          <li> New Brunswick has displayed lower GDP Growth Rates than other provinces and ranks among the lowest in GDP per capita 
           <ul>
            <li>This has many side effects including 
              <ul>            <li> Persistent out migration of young people</li> 
                <li> Higher reliance on federal transfers </li>
                <li> Lower level of provision of services by the province </li></ul>
           </li> </li>
           </ul>
          <li> New Brunswick must increase both GDP and GDP per capita to maintain the same level of services and a feasible tax base </li>
          <li> Low GDP growth risks the province not being able to service its debt 
          <ul><li>Addressed under <a href="Archived-Reports/Goal 19 2022 - Net Debt-to-GDP Ratio .pdf">Debt to GDP Ratio.</a></li></ul></li>
        </ul></p>
        <h3>Cause</h3>
        <p><ul><li>Slow GDP growth in the province as identified in the goals set by BoostNB is a result of many factors </li></ul></p>
        <h3>BoostNB Growth Philosophy</h3>
        <p>GDP can be looked at from a regional growth perspective. Regional growth for the province of New Brunswick 
            will involve a focus on the exports/base industries and the linkages they create. This can provide the groundwork 
            for categorizing the BoostNB stretch goals for the province to work towards. Using this, categories; Growth, Base, 
            Non-Base, Capture, and Non-Growth emerge. Below comprehensive descriptions of each will be outlined. </p>
        <h3>Growth Goals</h3>
        <p>Regional growth can be attributed to industries that participate in exporting and capture exporting wealth. These industries are considered 
            to make up the “base” of the New Brunswick economy, bringing in wealth that stimulates activity. This includes our natural resources and manufacturing 
            primarily; these are industries with international markets and competition. These major exporters are best utilized by “capturing” as much of 
            this wealth as possible through either creating supporting industries for these large exporters or enhancing the profitability of existing industries. 
            This “capture” has the effect of keeping export wealth within the economy. In New Brunswick, most people are employed in the “non-base” industries that 
            produce only for the local population such as restaurants and barbers. When the base industries grow, the non-base industries grow with them to support them. 
            For this reason, to grow the economy New Brunswick must stimulate export growth by capturing their full potential. How each of our categories fits into this model is shown below.

            <ul><li>Growth: GDP, Population</li>
              <li>Base: Natural Resources, Trade</li>
              <li>Non-Base: Labour</li>
              <li> Capture: Investment</li></ul> 
            
            For a more intuitive understanding of the flow of funds through an economy, it is useful to consult Figure 1. In this figure you can see that the only 
            place money comes in, is through export and the only places it goes out is through imports. With this model in mind, increasing exports relative to inputs 
            or increasing the amount of this money that stays within the province are the two ways to grow the economy. Exports can be increased by ensuring efficient 
            production through Investment, or by locally sourcing the inputs of major exporting industries. The economy can also grow by keeping money in the circular 
            portion of this chart for as long as possible. 
            </p>

        <h3>Non-Growth Goals</h3>
        <p>There is growing literature and debate surrounding whether growth should be the primary objective of developed economies. This is because past a certain 
            threshold of wealth, happiness and health is no longer increased by even more wealth. Rather, to serve the happiness of the New Brunswick population 
            and future generations it may be preferable to maintain such targets as Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions or equality. Income equality is shown to have a 
            profound effect on things such as happiness and many other key social indicators. For this reason, BoostNB has created “stretch goals” in the areas of 
            GHG Emissions, Life Satisfaction, and Income Equality. These goals do not necessarily contribute to economic growth but instead, serve to build a stronger society.

           <ul><li> Non-Growth Goals: Social and Environmental Welfare</li></ul>
            </p><br>
        <h3>In the Numbers</h3>
        <p>New Brunswick and the other Maritime provinces have the lowest GDP per capita of all provinces in Canada as shown in Figure 2. This means that the economic 
            activity and production of New Brunswickers is lower than other provinces. In 2021, this number equalled $40,100 (2012 Chained Dollars). This list was 
            topped by Canada’s oil and gas provinces, followed by its most urbanized provinces with the Maritime provinces occupying the last three places. </p>

        <div class="chart">
          <canvas id="barChart"></canvas>
        </div>       

        <p>New Brunswick also typically has low annual GDP growth rates, shown in Figure 3 on a year-to-year basis. The tendency is that New Brunswick weathers global 
            recissions, such as the 2008 financial crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic, slightly better than the national average but benefits much less during times of 
            recovery and in boom periods. This overall leads to New Brunswick lagging the nation. More can be found on this in <a href="Archived-Reports/Goal 00 2022 - Real GDP Growth .pdf">Real GDP Growth</a>.</p>

        <p>To show the weight that a lagging GDP or a growing debt is having on the economy we include a goal on the <a href="Archived-Reports/Goal 19 2022 - Net Debt-to-GDP Ratio .pdf">Net Debt to GDP Ratio.</a>. The primary findings are 
            displayed in Figure 4 showing that New Brunswick is not meeting the BoostNB goal of 30% debt to GDP ratio. </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>New Brunswick is not progressing at a satisfactory manner when it comes to achieving the goals relating to GDP growth. The reasons for this are on display 
            throughout this website. To catch up to other provinces, New Brunswick will have to improve in several key areas. To see these key areas, it is useful 
            to spend a few minutes exploring the BoostNB Dashboard for quick information on where New Brunswick is and is not performing well and where there is opportunity for change. </p>
